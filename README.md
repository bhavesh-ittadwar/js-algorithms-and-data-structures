## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

- This repo is here to track my weekly progress of my learnings about algorithms & data structures :)
- Everything will be implemented using JavaScript on NodeJs.
- To try what's baking here:
  - Make sure you have node installed
  - This is a very barebones project. For now I'm focusing on implementing several algorithms and maybe later work on a generic & interactive UI for the user so that they can play a little with the inputs and the algorithm.
  - Run index.js of whichever module you like in `src/lib/modules`
  - There's a generic `executor` function. As the name implies you execute a function but you can also optionally log the input and ouput for that function and even the performance as well if you pass the first two options i.e. `printLogs` & `printPerformance` as `true`.
