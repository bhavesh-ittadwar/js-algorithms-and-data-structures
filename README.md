## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

- This repo is here to track my weekly progress of my learnings about algorithms & data structures :)
- Everything will be implemented using JavaScript on NodeJs, HTML, SCSS.
- To try what's popping here:
  - Make sure you have node installed
  - First do `npm i`
  - After all the dependencies are installed run `npm start`
